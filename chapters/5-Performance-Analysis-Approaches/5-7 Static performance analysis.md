## Static Performance Analysis

Today we have extensive tooling for static code analysis. For C and C++ languages we have such well known tools like [Clang Static Analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/), [Klocwork](https://www.perforce.com/products/klocwork), [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) and others. They aim at checking the correctness and semantics of the code. Likewise, there are tools that try to address the performance aspect of code. Static performance analyzers don't execute or profile the program. Instead, they simulate the code as if it is executed on a real HW. Statically predicting performance is almost impossible, so there are many limitations to this type of analysis.

First, it is not possible to statically analyze C/C++ code for performance since we don't know the machine code to which it will be compiled. So, static performance analysis works on assembly code.

Second, static analysis tools simulate the workload instead of executing it. It is obviously very slow, so it's not possible to statically analyze the entire program. Instead, tools take a snippet of assembly code and try to predict how it will behave on real hardware. The user should pick specific assembly instructions (usually small loop) for analysis. So, the scope of static performance analysis is very narrow.

The output of static performance analyzers is fairly low-level and sometimes breaks execution down to CPU cycles. Usually, developers use it for fine-grained tuning of the critical code region where every cycle matters.

### Static vs. Dynamic Analyzers {.unlisted .unnumbered}

**Static tools** don't run the actual code but try to simulate the execution, keeping as many microarchitectural details as they can. They are not capable of doing real measurements (execution time, performance counters) because they don't run the code. The upside here is that you don't need to have the real HW and can simulate the code for different CPU generations. Another benefit is that you don't need to worry about consistency of the results: static analyzers will always give you deterministic output because simulation (in comparison with the execution on real hardware) is not biased in any way. The downside of static tools is that they usually can't predict and simulate everything inside a modern CPU: they are based on a model that may have bugs and limitations. Examples of static performance analyzers are [UICA](https://uica.uops.info/)[^2] and [llvm-mca](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.html)[^3].

**Dynamic tools** are based on running the code on the real HW and collecting all sorts of information about the execution. This is the only 100% reliable method of proving any performance hypothesis. As a downside, usually, you are required to have privileged access rights to collect low-level performance data like PMCs. It's not always easy to write a good benchmark and measure what you want to measure. Finally, you need to filter the noise and different kinds of side effects. Examples of dynamic microarchitectural performance analyzers are [nanoBench](https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench)[^5], [uarch-bench](https://github.com/travisdowns/uarch-bench)[^4] and a few others. 

A bigger collection of tools both for static and dynamic microarchitectural performance analysis is available [here](https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks/blob/master/performance.tools.md#microarchitecture)[^7].

### Case Study: Using UICA to Optimize FMA Throughput

One of the questions developers often ask is: "Latest processors have 10+ execution units; How do I write my code to keep them busy all the time?" This is indeed one the hardest questions to tackle. Sometimes it requires looking under the microscope at how the program is running. One of such microscopes is UICA simulator that allows you to have insights into how your code could be flowing through a modern processor.

Let's look at the code in [@lst:FMAthroughput]. We intentionally try to make the examples as simple as possible. Though real-world codes are of course usually more complicated than this. The code scales every element of array `a` by the constant `B` and accumulates scaled values into `sum`. On the right, we present the machine code for the loop generated by Clang-16 when compiled with `-O3 -ffast-math -march=core-avx2`. The assembly code look very compact, let's understand it better.

Listing: FMA throughput

~~~~ {#lst:FMAthroughput .cpp .numberLines}
float foo(float * a, float B, int N){  │ .loop:
  float sum = 0;                       │  vfmadd231ps ymm2, ymm1, ymmword [rdi + rsi]
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)          │  vfmadd231ps ymm3, ymm1, ymmword [rdi + rsi + 32]
    sum += a[i] * B;                   │  vfmadd231ps ymm4, ymm1, ymmword [rdi + rsi + 64]
  return sum;                          │  vfmadd231ps ymm5, ymm1, ymmword [rdi + rsi + 96]
}                                      │  sub rsi, -128
                                       │  cmp rdx, rsi
                                       │  jne .loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a reduction loop, i.e. we need to sum up all the products and in the end return a single float value. The way this code is written, there is a loop-carry dependency over `sum`. You cannot overwrite `sum` until you accumulate the previous product. A smart way to parallelize this is to have multiple accumulators and roll them up in the end. So, instead a single `sum`, we could have `sum1` to accumulate results from even iterations and `sum2` from odd iterations. This is what Clang-16 has done: it has 4 vectors (`ymm2`-`ymm5`) each holding 8 floating point accumulators, plus it used FMA to fuse multiplcation and addition into single instruction. The constant `B` is broadcasted into the `ymm1` register. The `-ffast-math` option allows a compiler to reassociate floating point operations, we will discuss it later in the book. By the way, the multiplication can be done only once after the loop. Definitely an oversight by the programmer, but hopefully compilers will be able to handle it in the future.

The code looks good, but is it really optimal? Let's find out. We took the assembly snippet from [@lst:FMAthroughput] to UICA and run simulations. At the time of writing, Alderlake (Intel's 12th gen, based on GoldenCove) is not supported by UICA, so we ran it on the latest available, which is RocketLake (Intel's 11th gen, based on SunnyCove). Although the architectures differ, the issue exposed by this experiment is equally visible on both. The result of simulation is shown on figure @fig:FMA_tput_UICA. This is a pipeline diagram similar to what we have shown in Chapter 3. We skipped the first two iterations, and show only iterations 2 and 3 (leftmost column "It."). This is when the execution reaches a steady state, all further iterations look very similar.

![UICA pipeline diagram. `I` = issued, `r` = ready for dispatch, `D` = dispatched, `E` = executed, `R` = retired.](../../img/perf-analysis/fma_tput_uica.png){#fig:FMA_tput_UICA width=100%}

UICA is a very simplified model of the actual CPU pipeline. For example, you may notice that instruction fetch and decode stages are missing. Also, UICA doesn't account for cache misses and branch mispredictions, so it assumes that all memory accesses always hit in L1 cache and branches are always predicted correctly. Which we know is not the case in modern processors. Again, this is irrelevant for our experiment as we could still use the simulation results to find a way to improve the code. Can you see the issue?

Let's examine the diagram. First of all, every `FMA` instruction is broken into two uops (see \circled{1}): a load uop that goes to ports `{2,3}` and an FMA uop that can go to ports `{0,1}`. The load uop has the latency of 5 cycles: starts at cycle 11 and finished at cycle 15. The FMA uop has the latency of 4 cycles: starts at cycle 19 and finishes at cycle 22. All FMA uops depend on load uops, we can clearly see this on the diagram: FMA uops always start after the corresponding load uop finishes. Now find two `r` cells at cycle 10, they are ready to be dispatched, but RocketLake has only two load ports, and both are already occupied in the same cycle. So, these two loads are issued in the next cycle.

The loop has four cross-iteration dependencies over `ymm2-ymm5`. The FMA uop from instruction \circled{2} that writes into `ymm2` cannot start execution before instruction \circled{1} from previous iteration finishes. Notice that the FMA uop from instruction \circled{2} was dispatched right in the same cycle 22 as instruction \circled{1} finished its execution. You can observe this pattern for other FMA instructions as well.

So, "what is the problem?", you ask. Look at the top right corner of the image. For each cycle, we added the number of executed FMA uops, this is not printed by UICA. It goes like `1,2,1,0,1,2,1,...`, or an average of one FMA uop per cycle. Most of the recent Intel processors have two FMA execution units, thus can issue two FMA uops per cycle. The diagram clearly shows the gap as every forth cycle there are no FMAs executed. As we figured out before, no FMA uops can be dispatched because their inputs (`ymm2-ymm5`) are not ready.

To increase the utilization of FMA execution units from 50% to 100%, we need to unroll the loop by a factor of two. This will double the number of accumulators from 4 to 8. Also, instead of 4 independent data flow chains, we would have 8. We will not shown the simulations of unrolled version here, you can experiment on your own. Instead, let us confirm the hypothesis by running two version on a real HW. By the way, this is always a good idea to verify since static performance analyzers like UICA are not accurate models. Below, we show the output of two [nanobench](https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench) tests that we ran on a recent Alderlake processor. The tool takes provided assembly instructions (`-asm` options) and creates a benchmark kernel. Readers can look up the meaning of other parameters in the nanobench documentation. The original code on the left executes 4 instructions in 4 cycles, while improved version can execute 8 instructions in 4 cycles. Now we can be sure we maximized the FMA execution throughput, the code on the right keeps the FMA units busy all the time.

                                             │ Core cycles: 4.02
```

As a rull of thumb, in such situations, the loop must be unrolled by a factor `T * L`, where `T` is the throughput of an instruction, and `L` is its latency. In our case, we should have unrolled it by `2 * 4 = 8` to achieve maximum FMA port utilization since the throughput of FMA on Alderlake is 2 and latency of FMA is 4 cycles. This creates 8 separate data flow chains that can be executed independently.

It's worth to mention that you will not always see 2x speedup in practice. It can only be achieved in an idealized environment like UICA or nanobench. In a real application, even though you maximized the execution throughput of FMA, the gains may be hindered by eventual cache misses and other pipeline hazards. When that happens, the effect of cache misses outweights the effect of suboptimal FMA port utilization. Which could easily result in much more disappointing 5% speedup. But don't worry you've still done the right thing. 

As a closing thought, let us remind you that UICA or any other static performance analyzer is not suitable for analyzing large portions of code. But they are great for exploring microarchitectural effects. Also, they help you building up a mental model of how CPU works. Another very important use case for UICA is to find critical dependency chains in a loop as described in the [post](https://easyperf.net/blog/2022/05/11/Visualizing-Performance-Critical-Dependency-Chains)[^8] on the easyperf blog.
